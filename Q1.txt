Q1. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with 
syntax and examples.

	Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether 
or not pieces of code can run.

There are multiple different types of conditionals in JavaScript including:

	“If” statements: where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code.

EXAMPLE

if (10 > 5) {
      var outcome = "if block";
}
​
outcome;

OUTPUT
"if block"

	“Else” statements: where if the same condition is false it specifies the execution for a block of code.


EXAMPLE

if ("cat" === "dog") {
      var outcome = "if block";
} else {
      var outcome = "else block";
}

outcome;

OUTPUT
"else block"

	“Else if” statements: this specifies a new test if the first condition is false.

EXAMPLE

if (false) {
      var outcome = "if block";
} else if (true) {
      var outcome = "else if block";
} else {
      var outcome = "else block";
}

outcome;

OUTPUT
"else if block"
